            <h4>Dear Visitor/Reader,</h4>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website, The Nerve Museum, serving mainly as a forum for selected things I’ve written over the years - essays, reviews, articles, and other pieces that seem to have some continued relevance or retrospective value. So I hope. The primary categories are contemporary art and culture, with a particular focus on what is now commonly called Outsider Art, after the title of an influential book by the late cultural scholar Roger Cardinal. As the author of my own books about Saint EOM (Eddie Owens Martin) and Howard Finster, both originally published in the late 1980s, I was pegged relatively early in my career as an authority on Outsider Art in the American South. I claim no authority other than that of an attentive writer, but I admit to having a longstanding interest in and enthusiasm for the subject, as a result of which I‘ve often been commissioned to write essays, deliver talks, or curate exhibitions related to the topic. 
            </p>

            <h4>What is the Nerve Museum? </h4>
            <p>
                Since 1992 my primary residence has been a garret apartment in a 1920s bungalow in a small city in North Carolina. Most of the wall space is covered with paintings, drawings, photographs, and other works by artists I’ve written about or been associated with, and most of the furniture serves as storage for a personal library of some 2,000 books. Volumes not shelved tend to be neatly stacked on tables, chairs, or other available surfaces. Three walk-in storage closets function mainly as repositories for my files, archives, and additional artworks in various mediums. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When my late brother Hunter visited in 1995, he (jokingly) observed that the place made him nervous, constantly concerned that he might accidentally knock something over and start a chain reaction of collapsing and overturned objects - a chaotic jumble of books and art, possibly damaged. Hunter took to calling the premises my Nerve Museum - a catchy name, so I adopted it.

                The first big batch of material herein is a self-selection of miscellaneous writings on outsider art and related topics, originally intended as a book manuscript. It includes its own table of contents and my brief introduction, which, among other things, explains the structure of this selection. Most of these writings have been previously published in slightly different forms, as detailed in italicized notes at the end of each pre-published piece. The cool gray lines of type are here and there relieved by captioned and credited photographs.

In both cases I’m essentially involved with the same concerns–art and the way it’s presented in museums and galleries. When writing as a critic, I’m an evaluator of art that I didn’t select and curatorial decisions I didn’t make. As a curator I’m an enthusiastic advocate for work that I’ve selected–art that has already passed my test, so to speak–and I write about what I see as its strengths and virtues.” Patterson doesn’t have one method of curation. Artists, themes, or materials may serve as the starting point for his exhibits. Much like his childhood experiences, Patterson’s professional life allows him to acknowledge all of the art that surrounds us, but still champion the pieces that speak to him in some special way."

        <h4>Chance Operations</h4>
        <p> 
            After at least one esteemed colleague, having been regaled with stories of my past, insisted I ought to write a memoir and goaded me repeatedly about it, I decided to take up the challenge. Writing “the story of my life” wasn’t the idea. Instead, I set out to write an account of my twenties - the decade I spent stumbling and experimenting and failing and succeeding to invent my adult, professional, social self, the mask of personal identity I wear. The project took on a life of its own and became a dominant theme for the better part of a decade, during which I’ve gone at it steadily although in necessarily piecemeal fashion, working around intermittent writing assignments, copy deadlines, curatorial projects, and other obligations undertaken for income-generating purposes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the latter connection, the memoir project has been a spare-time endeavor pursued for entirely personal, creative reasons, without the benefit of a publisher’s advance. The only financial support for the project to date has been a $2,500 grant from my local arts council (a Duke Energy Artist Project Fellowship from the Arts Council of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County). In order to best serve the narrative, I have extended the timeline into my early thirties, but otherwise I’ve adhered to the original idea. Two chapters have been previewed in regional literary journals - “Reconstituting Black Mountain” in Appalachian Journal, and “The Convivial Anarchists” in St. Andrews Review.
