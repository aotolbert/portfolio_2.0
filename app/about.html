        <h3>Chance Operations - A Memoir by Tom Patterson</h3>

        <p>
          After at least one esteemed colleague, having been regaled with stories of my past, insisted I ought to write a memoir and goaded me repeatedly about it, I decided to take up the challenge. Writing “the story of my life” wasn't the idea. Instead, I set out to write an account of my twenties - the decade I spent stumbling and experimenting and failing and succeeding to invent my adult, professional, social self, the mask of personal identity I wear. The project took on a life of its own and became a dominant theme for the better part of a decade, during which I've gone at it steadily although in necessarily piecemeal fashion, working around intermittent writing assignments, copy deadlines, curatorial projects, and other obligations undertaken for income-generating purposes.
        </p>
        <p>

          In the latter connection, the memoir project has been a spare-time endeavor pursued for entirely personal, creative reasons, without the benefit of a publisher's advance. The only financial support for the project to date has been a $2,500 grant from my local arts council (a Duke Energy Artist Project Fellowship from the Arts Council of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County). In order to best serve the narrative, I have extended the timeline into my early thirties, but otherwise I've adhered to the original idea. Two chapters have been previewed in regional literary journals - “Reconstituting Black Mountain” in Appalachian Journal, and “The Convivial Anarchists” in St. Andrews Review.
