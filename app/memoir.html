                After at least one esteemed colleague, having been regaled with stories of my past, insisted I ought to write a memoir and goaded me repeatedly about it, I decided to take up the challenge. Writing “the story of my life” wasn’t the idea. Instead, I set out to write an account of my twenties - the decade I spent stumbling and experimenting and failing and succeeding to invent my adult, professional, social self, the mask of personal identity I wear. The project took on a life of its own and became a dominant theme for the better part of a decade, during which I’ve gone at it steadily although in necessarily piecemeal fashion, working around intermittent writing assignments, copy deadlines, curatorial projects, and other obligations undertaken for income-generating purposes.

                In the latter connection, the memoir project has been a spare-time endeavor pursued for entirely personal, creative reasons, without the benefit of a publisher’s advance. The only financial support for the project to date has been a $2,500 grant from my local arts council (a Duke Energy Artist Project Fellowship from the Arts Council of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County). In order to best serve the narrative, I have extended the timeline into my early thirties, but otherwise I’ve adhered to the original idea. Two chapters have been previewed in regional literary journals - “Reconstituting Black Mountain” in Appalachian Journal, and “The Convivial Anarchists” in St. Andrews Review.

                This work is what I call a picaresque memoir, structured in two parts that fall in reverse chronological order, with the first part covering the years 1977 to 1984 and the second the period from 1971 to 1977, so that the ending circles back to the beginning. It’s not so much about me as about the places where I found myself and the other people I encountered. Featuring appearances by the B-52s, John Cage, Jimmy Carter, Robert Creeley, Buckmister Fuller, Allen Ginsberg, Col. Bruce Hampton, Arto Lindsay, and the Sex Pistols, among other luminaries. 
                At this writing about 80 per cent of each section is complete and I aim to wrap it up this year, the tail-end of the decade in which I began it. It’s high time. 
                This final section of nervemuseum.com consists of chapters excerpted from the manuscript, you can see what I have finished so far  <a href="./images/Chance Operations Part 1.pdf" download>here.</a>
